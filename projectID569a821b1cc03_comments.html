<HTML><BODY>John Worrel Keely was an inventor who claimed to have invented a machine that could tap vaporic or etheric energy, and hence supply limitless amounts of energy to drive machines, power guns, etc. He attracted numerous investors, and build tantalizing working prototypes, but failed to ever deliver a working model. After his death, hidden pneumatic pipes where discovered in his lab, which suggest that he used presurized air to run his prototypes.

<p>The author of this book, Clara Jessup Bloomfield Moore, was one of the primary investors, who put over $100.000 in the project. In this book, she sets out to explain the principles behind the motor. Unfortunately, not much sense can be made out of it. Not a single formula or diagram is to be found, and the work is riddled with (semi-)religious notions, poetry, and long explanations of what the machine is <i>not</i>.

<p>To this day, some people are trying to build machines according to the principles supposedly discovered by Keely.</BODY></HTML>
